# Philosophy

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. (Dasu and Johnson, 2003)

Thus before you can even start on any sort of sophisticated analysis or plotting, you first must: 

1. ***Manipulate*** data frames: filtering, summarizing, and conducting calculations across groups
2. ***Tidy*** data into the appropriate format

Historically there are two schools of thought within the R community...and at RPI!

* "We should stick to the base R functions for manipulating and tidying"
    * `tidyverse` uses syntax that's unlike base R and is superfluous.
    * This view is increasingly fading
* "We should start teaching students to manipulate data using `tidyverse` tools"
    * `tidyverse` methods are easy to use, more readable than base R, and speed up the tidying process.
    * This is the dominant view, and is what we believe!

# Welcome to the tidyverse!

This tutorial shows you some of the `tidyverse` tools so you can make an informed decision about whether you want to continue to suffer through Base R or enter the tidyverse.

# Example Dataset

For this unit, we'll be working with the "Gapminder" dataset, which is excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. For each of 142 countries, the data  provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
          stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(gapminder)
```

Another, more complete way to sanity-check our data types:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

# Dataframe Manipulation using Base R Functions

So far, youâ€™ve seen the basics of manipulating data frames, e.g. subsetting, merging, and basic calculations. 
For instance, we can use base R functions to calculate summary statistics across groups of observations,
e.g. the mean GDP per capita within each region:

```{r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", "gdpPercap"])
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", "gdpPercap"])
```

But this isn't ideal because it involves a fair bit of repetition. Repeating yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially introduce some nasty bugs.

We want our code to more closely resemble our _thinking_, which is "get the means by `continent`"

# Dataframe Manipulation Using dplyr

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes. These functions will save you time by reducing repetition. As an added bonus, you might even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

Here we're going to cover six of the most commonly used functions as well as using pipes (`%>%`) to combine them.

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `group_by()`
4. `summarize()`
5. `mutate()`
6. `arrange()`

`dplyr` will be installed when installing `tidyverse`, or you can install it by itself:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# not run
# install.packages('dplyr')
```

Now let's load the package:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

# dplyr `select()`

Imagine that we just received the gapminder dataset, but are only interested in a few variables in it. We could use the `select()` function to keep only the columns corresponding to variables we select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap)
head(year_country_gdp)
```

![](img/dplyr-fig1.png)

If we open up `year_country_gdp`, we'll see that it only contains the year, country and gdpPercap. This is equivalent to the base R subsetting function:

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder[,c("year", "country", "gdpPercap")]
head(year_country_gdp)
```

But, as we will see, `dplyr` makes for much more readible, efficient code because of its *pipe* operator.

# dplyr pipes

Above, we used what's called 'normal' grammar, but the strengths of `dplyr` lie in combining several functions using *pipes*. 

Pipes take the input on the left side of the `%>%` symbol and pass it in as the first argument to the function on the right side.

Since the pipe grammar is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's repeat what we've done above using pipes.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

* First we summon the gapminder dataframe and pass it on to the next step using the pipe symbol `%>%`
* The second step is the `select()` function. In this case we don't specify the data object to use in the call to `select()` since we've piped it in. 

**Fun Fact**: There is a good chance you have encountered pipes before in the Linux shell. In R, a pipe symbol is `%>%` while in the shell it is `|.` But the concept is the same!

# dplyr `filter()`

Now let's say we're only interested in African countries. We can combine `select()` and `filter()` to select only the observations where `continent` is `Africa`.

```{r}
year_country_gdp_africa <- gapminder %>%
    filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
    select(year,country,gdpPercap)
```

First we pass the `gapminder` dataframe to the `filter()` function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder dataframe to the `select()` function.

Both the `select()` and `filter()` functions subset the data frame. The difference is that `select()` extracts certain *columns*, while `filter()` extracts certain *rows*.

**Note:** The order of operations is very important in this case. If we used `select()` first, `filter()` would not be able to find the variable `continent` since we would have removed it in the previous step.

# dplyr Calculations across Groups

A common task you'll encounter when working with data is running calculations on different groups within the data. For example, what if we wanted to calculate the mean GDP per capita for each continent?

In base R, you would run the `mean()` function for each subset of data:

```{r}
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Africa"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Americas"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Asia"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Europe"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Oceania"])
```

That's a lot of repetition! To make matters worse, what if we wanted to then add these values to our original data frame as a new column? We would have to write something like this:

```{r}
gapminder$mean.continent.GDP <- NA  # Initialize a new column

# Write the values into the new column, for each continent 
gapminder$mean.continent.GDP[gapminder$continent == "Africa"] <- mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Africa"])

gapminder$mean.continent.GDP[gapminder$continent == "Americas"] <- mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Americas"])

gapminder$mean.continent.GDP[gapminder$continent == "Asia"] <- mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Asia"])

gapminder$mean.continent.GDP[gapminder$continent == "Europe"] <- mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Europe"])

gapminder$mean.continent.GDP[gapminder$continent == "Oceania"] <- mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Oceania"])
```

You can see how this can get pretty tedious, especially if we want to calculate more complicated or refined statistics. We could use loops or apply functions, but these can be difficult, slow, or error-prone. 

# dplyr "split-apply-combine"

The abstract problem we're encountering here is known as **split-apply-combine**:

![](img/splitapply.png)

We want to *split* our data into groups (in this case continents), *apply* some calculations on each group, then  *combine* the results together afterwards. 

There are ways to do split-apply-combine operations using the `apply()` family of functions, but those are error prone and messy.

Luckily, `dplyr` offers a much cleaner solution to this problem. 

```{r}
# remove the column se just added... There are two easy ways!
gapminder <- gapminder %>% select(-mean.continent.GDP)
# OR
gapminder$mean.continent.GDP <- NULL
```

# dplyr `group_by()`

We've already seen how `filter()` can help us select observations that meet certain criteria (in the above: `continent == "Europe"`). More helpful, however, is the `group_by()` function, which will essentially use every unique criteria that we could have used in `filter()`.

A `grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list` is a `data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular value `continent` (at least in the example above).

![](img/dplyr-fig2.png)

# dplyr `summarize()`

`group_by()` on its own is not particularly interesting. It's much more exciting used in conjunction with the `summarize()` function, which allows use to create new variable(s) by applying transformations to variables in each of the continent-specific data frames. 

In other words, when using the `group_by()` function, we split our original dataframe into multiple pieces, which we then apply summary functions to (e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarize()`.
The output is a new dataframe reduced in size, with one row per group.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents)
```

![](img/dplyr-fig3.png)

That allowed us to calculate the mean `gdpPercap` for each continent. But it gets even better -- the function `group_by()` allows us to group by _multiple_ variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents_byyear)
```

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining one new variable in `summarize()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop))
head(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)
```

# dplyr `mutate()`

What if we wanted to extend our original data frame with these values instead of creating a new object? For this, we can use the `mutate()` function, which is similar to `summarize()` except it creates new variables to the same dataframe that you pass into it.

```{r}
gapminder_with_extra_vars <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    mutate(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop))
head(gapminder_with_extra_vars)
```

We can use also use `mutate()` to create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
head(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)
```

# dplyr `arrange()`

As a last step, let's say we want to sort the rows in our data frame according to values in a certain column. We can use the `arrange()` function to do this. For instance, let's organize our rows by `year` (recent first), and then by `continent`. 

```{r}
gapminder_with_extra_vars <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    mutate(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop)) %>%
    arrange(desc(year), continent)
head(gapminder_with_extra_vars)
```

# dplyr Take-aways

* Human readable: the function names describe the action being done
* Piping: chain functions in a step-by-step way, rather than nesting
```{r}
# without pipes:

gapminder_with_extra_vars <- arrange(
    mutate(
      group_by(gapminder, continent, year), 
      mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap)
      ),
    desc(year), continent)
```
* Facilitates split-apply-combine manipulations

# Part II: Tidying Data

Even before we conduct analysis or calculations, we need to put our data into the correct format. The goal here is to rearrange a messy dataset into one that is **tidy**

The two most important properties of tidy data are:

1. Each column is a variable.
2. Each row is an observation.

Tidy data is easier to work with, because you have a consistent way of referring to variables (as column names) and observations (as row indices). It then becomes easy to manipulate, visualize, and model.

For more on the concept of *tidy* data, read Hadley Wickham's paper [here](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)

# Tidying Data: "Wide" vs. "Long" Formats

> "Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way." â€“ Hadley Wickham

Tabular datasets can be arranged in many ways. For instance, consider the data below. Each data set displays information on heart rate observed in individuals across 3 different time periods. But the data are organized differently in each table.

```{r}
wide <- data.frame(
  name = c("Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory"),
  time1 = c(67, 80, 64),
  time2 = c(56, 90, 50),
  time3 = c(70, 67, 101)
)
wide

long <- data.frame(
  name = c("Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory", "Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory", "Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory"),
  time = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  heartrate = c(67, 80, 64, 56, 90, 50, 70, 67, 10)
)
long
```

**Question**: Which one of these do you think is the *tidy* format?

**Answer**: The first dataframe (the "wide" one) would not be considered *tidy* because values (i.e., `heartrate`) are spread across multiple columns.

We often refer to these different structurs as "long" vs. "wide" formats. In the "long" format, you usually have 1 column for the observed variable and the other columns are ID variables. 

For the "wide" format each row is often a site/subject/patient and you have multiple observation variables containing the same type of data. These can be either repeated observations over time, or observation of multiple variables (or a mix of both). In the above case, we had the same kind of data (heart rate) entered across 3 different columns, corresponding to three different time periods.

![](img/tidyr-fig1.png)

You may find data input may be simpler and some programs/functions may prefer the "wide" format. However, many of Râ€™s functions have been designed assuming you have "long" format data. 

# Tidying the `gapminder` Data

Let's revisit the structure of our gapminder dataframe:

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

**Question**: Is this data frame **wide** or **long**?

**Answer**: This data frame is somewhere in between the purely 'long' and 'wide' formats:

* We have three "ID variables" (`continent`, `country`, `year`)
* We have three "Observation variables" (`pop`, `lifeExp`, `gdpPercap`)

Despite not having ALL observations in one column, this intermediate format makes sense given that all three observation variables have different units. As we have seen, many of the functions in R are often vector based, and you usually do not want to do mathematical operations on values with different units.

On the other hand, there are some instances in which a purely long or wide format is ideal (e.g. plotting). Likewise, sometimes you'll get data on your desk that is poorly organized, and you'll need to **reshape** it.

# Enter the tidyr package...

Thankfully, the `tidyr` package will help you efficiently transform your data regardless of original format.

```{r}
# Install the "tidyr" package 
# install.packages("tidyr") # Not Run

# Load the "tidyr" package (necessary every new R session)
library(tidyr)
```

# tidyr `gather()`

Until now, weâ€™ve been using the nicely formatted original `gapminder` dataset. This dataset is not quite wide and not quite long -- it's something in the middle, but 'real' data (i.e. our own research data) will never be so well organized. Here let's start with the wide format version of the gapminder dataset.

```{r}
gap_wide <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_wide.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(gap_wide)
```

The first step towards getting our nice intermediate data format is to first convert from the wide to the long format. 
The function `gather()` will 'gather' the observation variables into a single variable. This is sometimes called "melting" your data, because it melts the table from wide to long. Those data will be melted into two variables: one for the variable names, and the other for the variable values. 

```{r}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
    gather(obstype_year, obs_values, 3:38)
head(gap_long)
```

Notice that we put three arguments into the `gather()` function: 

1. the name for the _new_ column for the new ID variable (`obstype_year`), 
2. the name for the _new_ amalgamated observation variable (`obs_value`), 
3. the indices of the old variables (`3:38`, signalling columns `3` through `38`) that we want to gather into one variable. Notice that we don't want to melt down columns `1` and `2`; these are considered "ID" variables.

# tidyr `select()`

If there are many columns or they're named in a consistent pattern, we might not want to select them using the column numbers. Sometimes it's easier to use some information contained in the names themselves.

We can select variables using:

* variable indices
* variable names (without quotes)
* `x:z` to select all variables between x and z
* `-y` to *exclude* y
* `starts_with(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`: all names that starts with `x`
* `ends_with(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`: all names that ends with `x`
* `contains(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`: all names that contain `x`

See the `select()` function in `dplyr` for more options.

For instance, here we do the same gather operation with (1) the `starts_with` function, and (2) the `-` operator:

```{r}
# with the starts_with() function
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
    gather(obstype_year, obs_values, starts_with('pop'),
           starts_with('lifeExp'), starts_with('gdpPercap'))
head(gap_long)

# with the - operator
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(obstype_year, obs_values, -continent, -country)
head(gap_long)
```

However you choose to do it, notice that the output collapses all of the measure variables into two columns: one containing new ID variable, the other containing the observation value for that row. 

# tidyr `separate()`

You'll notice that in our long dataset, `obstype_year` actually contains 2 pieces of information, the observation type (`pop`, `lifeExp`, or `gdpPercap`) and the `year`.

We can use the `separate()` function to split the character strings into multiple variables:

```{r}
gap_long_sep <- gap_long %>% 
  separate(obstype_year, into = c('obs_type','year'), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
head(gap_long_sep)
```

If you didn't use `tidyr` to do this, you'd have to use the `strsplit` function and use multiple lines of code to replace the column in `gap_long` with two new columns. This solution is much cleaner.

# tidyr spread

The opposite of `gather()` is `spread()`. It spreads our observation variables back out to make a wider table. We can use this function to spread our `gap_long()` to the original "medium" format.

```{r}
gap_medium <- gap_long_sep %>% 
  spread(obs_type, obs_values)
head(gap_medium)
```

All we need is some quick fixes to make this dataset identical to the original `gapminder` dataset:

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
head(gap_medium)
head(gapminder)

# rearrange columns
gap_medium <- gap_medium[,names(gapminder)]
head(gap_medium)

# arrange by country, continent, and year
gap_medium <- gap_medium %>% 
  arrange(country,continent,year)
head(gap_medium)
```

# Extra Resources

`dplyr` and `tidyr` have many more functions to help you wrangle and manipulate your data. See the  [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) for more.

There are some other useful packages in the [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org):

* `ggplot2` for plotting (I'll cover this in module 8)
* `readr` and `haven` for reading in data with structure other than csv
* `stringr`, `lubridate`, `forcats` for manipulating strings, dates, and factors, respectively
* many more!

# Exercises:

### dplyr

1. Use dplyr to create a data frame containing the median `lifeExp` for each continent

2. Use dplyr to add a column to the gapminder dataset that contains the total population of the continent of each observation in a given year. For example, if the first observation is Afghanistan in 1952, the new column would contain the population of Asia in 1952. 

3. Use dplyr to: add a column called `gdpPercap_diff` that contains the difference between the observation's `gdpPercap` and the mean `gdpPercap` of the continent in that year. Arrange the dataframe by the column you just created, in descending order (so that the relatively richest country/years are listed first)

**hint**: You might have to `ungroup()` before you `arrange()`.

### tidyr

4. Subset the results from question #3 to select only the `country`, `year`, and `gdpPercap_diff` columns. Use tidyr put it in wide format so that countries are rows and years are columns.
